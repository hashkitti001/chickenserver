## Chicken Server 


The Chicken Server is a desktop application written in 

Python used to create a http server for a directory

I built it to stream local videos on my hard drive


To run it:
Clone the repo 


`git clone https://www.github.com/hashkitti001/chickenserver`
simply type in your terminal 


Navigate into the directory with:
`cd chickenserver`


Then lastly,
`python3 -m chicken_server.py`


Type in the file path and voila, your server is live 
## Streaming from the server
Get your IP address by typing in your terminal
`ifconfig`
Type in 

`https://{ip_address}:port number on your terminal from the application` in your browser and you're good to go
